## Overview

HealthSync is a full-stack healthcare management platform that brings patients, doctors, pharmacists, and hospital administrators onto a single system. It covers the full care loop — doctor discovery, appointment booking, AI-assisted symptom triage, digital prescriptions, billing, and pharmacy inventory — behind a JWT and role-based access control layer, with Socket.IO powering real-time updates across every portal.

The platform ships with a reference dataset of 140 doctors across all 14 districts of Kerala, India, spanning five specializations, so it's fully explorable out of the box.

## Key Features

### 🧑‍⚕️ Patient Portal
- Doctor discovery filtered by district and specialization
- Appointment booking against a doctor's live availability calendar
- **AI Symptom Checker** — LLM-based triage before booking, logged for review
- E-prescriptions with one-tap refill requests
- Consolidated medical history timeline
- Bill viewing and payment via Stripe Checkout or a mock gateway for local dev
- Live in-app notifications for confirmations, rejections, and reschedules

### 👨‍⚕️ Doctor Portal
- Appointment queue with accept / reject / reschedule / mark-missed actions
- Configurable weekly availability that drives patient-facing slot generation
- Digital prescription authoring linked to the patient's file
- Full patient file view with medical history
- Follow-up visit scheduling
- Consultation bill generation
- KYC submission — new accounts stay `pending_approval` until admin sign-off

### 🛡️ Admin Console
- KYC review queue for onboarding doctors
- Full CRUD over doctors, hospitals, specializations, and inventory
- Platform-wide AI symptom-check audit log
- Central oversight of the doctor directory and hospital network

### 💊 Pharmacist Portal
- Prescription fulfillment dashboard with dispense-status tracking
- Visibility into hospital medicine stock and low-stock alerts

### ⚙️ Platform-Wide
- JWT auth in httpOnly cookies with 4-role RBAC (patient / doctor / admin / pharmacist)
- Resource-ownership checks — a valid token alone can't read someone else's records
- Socket.IO real-time layer with online-presence tracking
- Graceful-degradation avatar pipeline: UI Avatars → DiceBear → RoboHash → static default, with optional DALL·E 3 / Stability AI generation when keys are configured
- Structured logging (Winston) and HTTP access logs (Morgan)
- Dark / light theme support

The SPA talks to the Express API over REST for standard reads/writes and holds a persistent Socket.IO connection for live notifications. Controllers are the single point of contact with MongoDB and every external service (Stripe, the OpenRouter LLM, avatar providers) — the client never calls third parties directly. Every request passes through JWT verification, role authorization, and, for patient/doctor-scoped resources, an ownership check before it reaches a controller.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** `20.19+` or `22.12+` (required by Vite 7 in the frontend)
- **MongoDB** — local instance or a connection string (e.g. MongoDB Atlas)
- npm (ships with Node.js)

Optional, for full feature coverage:
- A Stripe test-mode account (billing)
- An OpenRouter API key (AI Symptom Checker)
- An OpenAI and/or Stability AI key (photorealistic doctor avatars — otherwise falls back to free avatar services automatically)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuzammilCk/HealthCare.git
cd HealthCare
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
# Core
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/healthsync
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_long_random_string
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
LOG_LEVEL=info
CONSULTATION_FEE=500

# Optional — Stripe billing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

# Optional — AI Symptom Checker
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=

# Optional — premium doctor-avatar generation
OPENAI_API_KEY=
STABILITY_API_KEY=
```

Start the API:

```bash
npm run dev      # nodemon, auto-reload
# or
npm start        # plain node
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create `frontend/.env` (see `frontend/.env.example`):

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 4. Seed the database (optional but recommended)

From `backend/`, with `MONGODB_URI` configured:

```bash
node seedInitialData.js     # specializations & base reference data
node seedDoctors.js         # 140 doctors from doctor.csv, across 14 Kerala districts
node seedHospitals.js       # hospital records
node seedInventory.js       # pharmacy stock
```

To wipe local data during development:

```bash
npm run clear-db
```

## API Reference

All routes are mounted under `/api`. Authentication is via an httpOnly `token` cookie (or a `Bearer` header for legacy clients).

| Route | Description | Primary Access |
|---|---|---|
| `/auth` | Register, login, logout, session bootstrap | Public |
| `/profile` | View/update the authenticated user's profile & avatar | Any authenticated role |
| `/patients` | Patient-facing resources | Patient |
| `/doctors` | Profile, availability/slots, appointment lifecycle, prescriptions, KYC, billing | Doctor |
| `/specializations` | Specialization directory | Public read · Admin write |
| `/admin` | KYC approvals, doctor/hospital/inventory management | Admin |
| `/notifications` | Notification retrieval & read-state | Any authenticated role |
| `/ai/check-symptoms` | LLM-backed symptom triage | Patient |
| `/mock-payments` | Simulated checkout for local development | Patient |
| `/bills` | Bill retrieval and generation | Patient · Doctor |
| `/medical-history` | Longitudinal patient record | Patient · Doctor |
| `/inventory` | Hospital medicine stock, low-stock alerts | Doctor · Admin |
| `/pharmacy` | Prescription fulfillment status | Pharmacist |

## Security

- **Authentication** — JWTs issued on login and stored in httpOnly cookies (mitigates token theft via XSS), with a `Bearer` header fallback for non-browser clients.
- **Authorization** — a 4-role RBAC model (`patient`, `doctor`, `admin`, `pharmacist`) enforced per route via `authorize`/`restrictTo` middleware.
- **Ownership checks** — dedicated middleware (`ensureOwnPatientData`, `validateAppointmentOwnership`) ensures a valid token alone isn't sufficient to read another user's records; role authorization and resource ownership are checked independently.
- **Input sanitization** — a custom middleware strips script/iframe/object/embed tags, `javascript:`/`data:` URIs, and inline event handlers, then HTML-escapes the remainder, on every `body`, `query`, and `params` payload.
- **Security headers** — CSP, HSTS, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `X-XSS-Protection` are set on every response.
- **Rate limiting** — `express-rate-limit` plus a custom sliding-window limiter guard sensitive endpoints.
- **Password storage** — bcrypt-hashed with a per-user salt; the hash is excluded from queries by default (`select: false`).
- **Doctor onboarding gate** — new doctor accounts default to `pending_approval` and are invisible to patients until an admin approves their KYC submission.
