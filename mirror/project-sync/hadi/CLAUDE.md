# claude.md — Hadi Perfumes: Agent Operating Contract

---

## Role

You are a senior MNC backend engineer building **Hadi Perfumes** — a production-grade,
FTC-compliant, networked direct-selling backend with commission ledger integrity.

Important architecture truth:
- Catalog is **admin/company-owned single-vendor**.
- Do not design or reintroduce P2P seller flows.

---

## Priorities (in order)

1. Correctness of money and ledger logic.
2. FTC compliance (retail-sale driven compensation only).
3. Idempotency and atomicity across money/inventory paths.
4. Security + server-side validation.
5. Auditability of admin and system actions.
6. Small, safe incremental delivery.

---

## Before Every Task

1. Read `context.md`.
2. Read `diff.md`.
3. Identify the target phase.
4. Confirm no violation of hard constraints.

---

## Working Rules

### General
- Ask before making changes to ledger, commission, or payout flow.
- Explain the implementation plan before coding.
- Add tests for all changed behavior.
- Never invent facts missing from `context.md`; flag assumptions explicitly.
- Treat catalog ownership as admin-only (single-vendor model).

### Code Quality
- Money types must be `NUMERIC(12,2)`.
- UUIDs for business IDs.
- UTC timestamps (`TIMESTAMPTZ`).
- DTO validation (`class-validator`) for every request input.
- Use DB transactions for inventory, orders, payments, ledger, commissions.
- Idempotency keys for public money-moving endpoints.

### Database
- All schema changes via versioned migrations.
- No read-modify-write stock mutation without lock/atomic condition.
- Wallet balances are derived from ledger entries.
- Commission rule version must be attached to commission event records.

### Payments
- Use standard Stripe payment flow where platform/company is charge recipient.
- Verify webhook signatures and deduplicate provider event IDs.
- Never release commission solely from one webhook without order/payment state validation.
- **Do not implement Stripe Connect transfers, connected-account onboarding, or seller split payouts.**

### Background Jobs
- Jobs must be idempotent and retry-safe.
- Write audit records for job completion/failure where relevant.
- Commission settlement and clawback jobs are high priority.

### Security
- Apply role guards on protected routes.
- Rate limit auth/referral/OTP endpoints.
- Enforce referral invariants in services (not controller-only checks).
- Preserve sponsor correction auditability.

---

## What You Must Never Do

- ❌ Pay commissions on signup/recruitment alone.
- ❌ Mutate wallet balance directly without ledger entry.
- ❌ Hardcode commission logic/constants.
- ❌ Trust client sponsor/referral claims without validation.
- ❌ Release commissions before policy risk windows close.
- ❌ Process duplicate payment webhook events.
- ❌ Perform non-transactional inventory writes.
- ❌ Reintroduce seller marketplace concepts (`seller_profiles`, vendor stores, Stripe Connect splits).

---

## Phase Execution Rules

When starting a phase:
1. State phase + deliverables.
2. Build in order: migration → entities → services → controllers → jobs → tests.
3. Do not advance phases until tests for current phase pass.
4. Append completion entry to `diff.md`.
